## 📌 Overview

This project is focused on analyzing dengue data, building predictive models for patient health outcomes, and supporting public health decision-making. Additionally, it includes a market research report on medical and pharmaceutical delivery models in India.

All outputs — from models to dashboards and research — are integrated into a single, user-friendly website.

## 🚀 Features

- **✅ Data Collection & Cleaning**  
  Collected initial data from Kaggle and supplemented it with scraped data using AI tools for better quality and coverage.

- **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Explored patterns in symptoms, demographics, and environmental factors like rainfall and ward-level case distribution.

- **🧠 Machine Learning Models**
  1. **Outcome Prediction** – Classifies patients as *Recovered, Hospitalized, Critical,* or *Dead*.  
  2. **High-Risk Prediction** – Quickly identifies patients likely to become Critical or Dead.  
  3. **Demand & Resource Forecast** – Forecasts ward-level medical resource demand *(still under improvement due to overfitting).*

- **🖥️ UI Interface**  
  Simple and interactive interface to test models directly on the website.

- **📈 Power BI Dashboard**  
  Embedded dashboard with 3 sheets:
  - **Overview of Cases**
  - **Symptom & Risk Analysis**
  - **Demand Forecast & Resource Planning**

- **📚 Competitive Research Report**  
  Comprehensive research on medical/pharma delivery models in India with focus on:
  - Delivery timelines
  - Service coverage
  - Logistics models
  - Innovations & features
